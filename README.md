# FullStack-Test
My idea was to build a new plugin working as REST API and consume it via a react app
# BackEnd
I build a plugin using MVC
* It contains 5 routes
  - connections/v1/list : To get connections list
  - connections/v1/users-list : To get users list
  - /add, /accept, /reject : To deal with requests

# FrontEnd
I create a React app to handle the users list from the db
[EXPECTED]
- Logged in user must be removed from displayed users list.
- Every user card will display a button according the status of connection between current user and displayed user (ADD / REJECT)

# A big thanks for you.
